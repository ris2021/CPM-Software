Sokoban is a Japanese puzzle game created in 1981 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi.

The player úû is confined to the board and may move horizontally or vertically
onto empty squares. The player can move a box òó (only one) by walking up to
it and push it to the square beyond. Boxes cannot be pulled, and they cannot
be pushed to squares with walls or other boxes. The number of boxes equals the
number of storage locations (::).

The puzzle is solved when all boxes are placed at storage locations (ôõ).
